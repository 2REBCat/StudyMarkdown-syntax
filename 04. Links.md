# Section Links
When you make header, then Section link is automatically made next to header text. You can get a link to go directly to section. I think it is a github feature. So you can not use it outside of github like vscode preview.

# Relative links
When you make a link, you can use relative link operands, such as ./ and ../. Your repository is root and you can use the relative path. If someone clone your repo, URL can be changed. So Github recommend using relative links.
