# Quoting text
Use ">" for quoting text like,

\>text is
>text

While automatically generate a box and put the contents inside in github dev preview, in github webpage, text is just indented and color is changed a little bit gray color. And the first four blank between "\>" and contents is omitted.

# Quoting code
Use "```"(three backticks) for quoting code like,

\```\
text\
\```\
is

```
text
```
You need to insert newline at each side of text. Then the content can get thier own block. (Making this example, now I finally find how to insert newline!!)\
In github docs, there is short cut "ctrl+E" or "Command+E" but in github dev, it is other feature's short cut, so you can't use it.
