# Lists
## Unordered lists
Use "-", "*", "+" for making unordered lists.\
These need blank after them like Headers.

```
- Hello
* My name is
+ 2REBCat
```

- Hello
* My name is
+ 2REBCat

## Ordered lists
It's funny. Just type number what you want to start with. And then number is automatically increased whatever you type any other number.

```
2. I want my list to start with 2
3. third now
1. what the... How do I make new ordered list?
```

## Nested Lists
Use space characters(like Tab or at least 4 blanks) in front of item and write "-" or "*" then you can make nested list. After second nested item, list bullet point is not chagned.

```
1. First
    - Nested item
        - Second nested item
            - How about third nested item?
```

        - Second nested item

## Task list
You can make check list using "- [ ]". If task has done, then use "- [x]".\
There is blank between "-" and "[" and "]".\
It is only working in github, not github dev...
