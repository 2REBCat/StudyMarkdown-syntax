# Images
Use "!\[Alt text\]\(Image link\)" for inseting images in md file.\
GitHub support to insert images when you write issues, pull requests, discussions, comments and md files.\
And link can use relative link, if image is in your repo.

So, "!\[My cat\]\(./images/Mycats.jpg\) is
![My cat](./images/Mycats.jpg)
