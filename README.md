# StudyMarkdown-syntax

It is for studying markdown syntax.

I wanted to write my Intro in 2REBCat repo, but I realized that I didn't know about markdown...😢

(Until now, I don't know how to insert new line. So I typed two enter for making new line...🤦‍♂️)

Because of that, I start to study markdown syntax!!\
It is summary of [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Please let me know if there is something wrong info or syntax..🙏🙏🙏
