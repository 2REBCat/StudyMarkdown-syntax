# StudyMarkdown-syntax

It is for studying markdown syntax.

I wanted to write my Intro in 2REBCat repo, but I realized that I didn't know about markdown...😢

(Since now, I don't know how to insert new line, so I type two enter for making new line...🤦‍♂️)

Because of that, I start to study markdown syntax!!

Please let me know if there is something wrong info or syntax..🙏🙏🙏
