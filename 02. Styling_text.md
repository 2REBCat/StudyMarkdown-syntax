# Bold
Use "**" or "__"(two underscore) each side of text without blank like,

\*\*text\*\* is **text**.

\_\_text\_\_ is __text__.

The difference is that if you use "**" than you can concate other word like,

\*\*text\*\*something_blah_blah is **text**something_blah_blah.

However "__" can not connect with other word,

\_\_text\_\_something_blah_blah is __text__something_blah_blah.
