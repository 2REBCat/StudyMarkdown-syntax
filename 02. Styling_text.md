# Bold
Use "**" or "__"(two underscore) at each side of text without a blank like,

\*\*text\*\* is **text**.

\_\_text\_\_ is __text__.

The difference is that if you use "**" than you can link other word like,

\*\*text\*\*something_blah_blah is **text**something_blah_blah.

However "__" can not connect with other word,

\_\_text\_\_something_blah_blah is just __text__something_blah_blah.

# Italic
Use "*" or "_"(just one underscore) at each side of text without a blank like,

\*text\* is *text*.

\_text\_ is _text_.

"*" and "_" also have a difference like __bold__. "\_" can not link with other word.

\*text\*something_blah_blah is *text*something_blah_blah.

\_text\_something_blah_blah is _text_something_blah_blah.
