# Bold
Use "**" or "__"(two underscore) at each side of text without a blank like,

\*\*text\*\* is **text**.

\_\_text\_\_ is __text__.

The difference is that if you use "**" than you can link other word like,

e.g.) \*\*text\*\*something_blah_blah is **text**something_blah_blah.

However "__" can not connect with other word except special characters,

e.g.1) \_\_text\_\_something_blah_blah is just __text__something_blah_blah.

e.g.2) "\_\_text\_\_"something_blah_blah is just "__text__"something_blah_blah.

# Italic
Use "*" or "_"(just one underscore) at each side of text without a blank like,

\*text\* is *text*.

\_text\_ is _text_.

"*" and "_" also have a difference like __bold__. "\_" can not link with other word except special characters.

e.g.1) \*text\*something_blah_blah is *text*something_blah_blah.

e.g.2) \_text\_something_blah_blah is _text_something_blah_blah.

e.g.3) "\_text\_"something_blah_blah is "_text_"something_blah_blah.

# Bold and nested italic
Use "**" and "_" together like,

\*\*blah \_text\_ blah\*\* is **blah _text_ blah**.

\_blah \*\*text\*\* blah\_ is also _blah **test** blah_.

You just choose a way how to emphasize word in italic or bold sentenses.

# All bold and italic
Use "***" at each side of text without a blank like,

\*\*\*text\*\*\* is ***text***.

# Superscript
Use \<sup>\</sup>, look like HTML tag.

blah\<sup>1</sup> is blah<sup>1</sup>.

It can't make footer. If you want to make footer, watch [this](https://github.com/2REBCat/StudyMarkdown-syntax/blob/main/08.%20Other%20good%20feature.md#footnotes).

# Subscript
Use \<sub>\</sub>, look like HTML tag.

blah\<sub>1\</sub> is blah<sub>2</sub>.

# Strikethrough
Use "~~" at ach side of text without a blank like,

\~~text\~~ is ~~text~~.

And also can nested with ~~**Bold**~~ or ~~*Italic*~~.
